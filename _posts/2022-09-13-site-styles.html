<h2>Example of a text snippet (with normal, monospaced and code text)</h2>
<p>You’ll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>
<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>
<p><code>YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>
<p>Where <code>YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code>MONTH</code> and <code>DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code>MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>
<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Check out the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home">jekyll-docs</a> for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at <a href=""https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll>Jekyll’s GitHub repo</a>. If you have questions, you can ask them on <a href="https://talk.jekyllrb.com/"">Jekyll Talk</a>.</p>
<h2>Example of keyboard inputs</h2>
<p>default:</p>
<pre class="no-shade"><kbd>haha</kbd></pre>
<p>bash:</p>
<pre class="no-shade"><kbd class="bash">haha</kbd></pre>
<p>cmd:</p>
<pre class="no-shade"><kbd class="cmd">haha</kbd></pre>
<p>zsh:</p>
<pre class="no-shade"><kbd class="zsh">haha</kbd></pre>
<h2>Example of code without background or highlight (usually used for screen output)</h2>
<pre class="no-shade"><code>def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
</code></pre>
<h2>Example of equation rendering</h2>
<p>Block equation:</p>
$$
f(x)=x^2
$$
<p>Inline equation: \(a^2+b^2=c^2\)</p>
<h2>Example of inline quote and blockquote</h3>
<p>According to Shakespeare, <q>To be or not to be, that is the question.</q></p>
<p>Favorite excerpt from <cite>The Kite Runner</cite></p>
<blockquote>
  And suddenly Hassan’s voice whispered in my head: For you, a thousand times over. Hassan the harelipped kite runner.
